I am a Master's student in the <a href='https://ce.sharif.edu/'>Computer Engineering Department</a> of the <a href='https://en.sharif.edu/'>Sharif University of Technology(SUT)</a>, where I serve as a Research Assistant at the <a href='http://ipl.ce.sharif.edu/'>Image Processing Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvx4PvgAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Kasaei</a>.

In the summer of 2022, I was a Research Intern at <a href='ispgroup.gitlab.io'>Image and Signal Processing Group</a>, <a href='https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html'>UCLouvain</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xb3Zc3cAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. De Vleeschouwer</a>. Before joining SUT, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at <a href='https://english.iut.ac.ir/'>Isfahan University of Technology (IUT)</a>. I was an undergraduate Research Assistant in the Computer Vision Lab under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=mZGNr2QAAAAJ'>Dr. Karimi</a>.


My research addresses visual recognition tasks like Multi-Object Tracnd, Person Re-Identification, and Semantic Segmentation. I am mainly working on the Tracking and Segmentation of players in team sports videos, specifically in soccer videos. Besides, I am also interested in compacting deep networks and transferring knowledge through Knowledge Distillation. Furthermore, my research interests include Self-supervised Learning.
